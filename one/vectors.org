* Vectors

- "You can't add apples and oranges". In a strange way, this is the reason for vectors.
- We have two separate numbers $v_1$ and $v_2$. That pair produces a
  *two dimensional vector* $v$

$v = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix}$

** Vector Addition

$v = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix}$

$w = \begin{bmatrix} w_1 \\ w_2 \end{bmatrix}$

$v + w = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 + w_1 \\ v_2 + w_2 \end{bmatrix}$

Subtraction of vectors follow the same idea.

** Scalar Multiplication

$2v = \begin{bmatrix} 2v_1 \\ 2v_2 \end{bmatrix}$

** Zero Vector

The sum of the vector $-v$ and $v$ is the zero vector. This is $\mathbf{0}$
wich is not the same as number zero.

The vector $\mathbf{0}$ has two components $0$ and $0$.

* Linear combination

Combining addition with scalar multiplication, we form *"linear
combinations"* of $v$ and $w$.
